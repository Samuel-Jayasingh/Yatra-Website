        <p>Box cricket, also known as indoor cricket or gully cricket, is a popular informal version of cricket played in confined spaces such as streets, alleys, or building corridors. It is typically played with a tennis ball and a makeshift bat, often a plank of wood or a cricket bat modified for the small space. The rules are simplified compared to traditional cricket, with smaller teams, shorter matches, and improvised boundaries. Box cricket is a favourite pastime in urban areas, offering a fast-paced and exciting version of the sport accessible to players of all ages and skill levels.</p>
